Application:
    --An application is a software program used to perform specific tasks.
    --An application provide different services to the user.
    --It can either with or without an internet connection.
    Examples: Calculator, Web browser, VLC player.

Applications are divided into two types.
1. Standalone Application
2. Web Application

1. Standalone Applications:
    --Standalone application are installable software that can run independently without requiring an internet connection.
    --Standalone applications have all their essential components bundled together, so they don't depend on anything external.
    --Standalone applications are self-sufficient, utilizing hardware and resources from the local machine, and do not depend on external hardware or resources from other devices.
    --Users need to manually install updates for standalone applications because they don't get updated automatically from the internet.
    Example: Offline text editors, music players, calculators, and simple games are common examples of standalone applications.

Web Applications:
    --Web application are multiuser applications, meaning that multiple users can interact with the application simultaneously.

    --A web application, or web app, is a type of software program that operates on a web server and is accessed through a web browser.

    --You don't need to download or install a web app on your computer; you can just go to a website by typing its URL to use it.

    --Example: Web applications like Gmail, YouTube, Facebook, Amazon, and Google Docs are accessed through a web browser, and these are common examples of web applications.

    --Web applications require an internet connection because they depend on resources available on remote servers.
    
    --Web applications update automatically, so users always have the latest version when they use them in their web browser.

    --Entire world can access web application, while specific user can access standalone application.

Types of web application
    --Web applications can be broadly categorized into two main types: static and dynamic.

Static web application:
    --The output of a static web application is the same for all users.
    --Static web applications are typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    --Developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create static web pages that show content to users without needing server-side processing.

Dynamic web application:
    --The output of a dynamic web application can vary based on factors such as user actions, geographic location, time, or search queries.
    --Dynamic web applications are commonly built using server-side programming frameworks such as Django (Python), Laravel (PHP), Spring (Java), and others.
