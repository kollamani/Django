A web application architecture in Python using Django typically follows a Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern and includes several integrated components for handling requests, processing data, rendering responses, and managing data storage.

🧱 Django Web Application Architecture Overview
1. Client (Frontend / Browser)
Sends HTTP requests to the server

Receives HTML/CSS/JS or JSON responses (if using an API)
Can be traditional HTML rendered by Django or a frontend SPA (React, Vue, etc.)

2. Web Server (e.g., Nginx, Apache)
Receives incoming requests from the client
Forwards them to the WSGI application server

3. WSGI Server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI)
Acts as a bridge between the web server and Django
Runs the Django app and returns HTTP responses

4. Django Application (Core)
a. URL Dispatcher (urls.py)
Maps incoming URLs to views

b. Views (views.py)
Handles logic for requests
Communicates with models
Returns responses (HTML, JSON, etc.)

c. Models (models.py)
Defines the structure of data (ORM)
Maps to database tables

d. Templates (templates/)
HTML templates with Django’s template language
Rendered by views to return to the client

e. Forms (forms.py)
Used for input validation and form rendering

f. Middleware
Intercepts requests/responses for additional processing (e.g., authentication, logging)

5. Database
Supported: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle
Django ORM manages database interactions

6. Static & Media Files
Managed separately using Django’s staticfiles system or external storage (AWS S3, etc.)

🔁 Django Request-Response Cycle
[Client] → [Nginx] → [Gunicorn (WSGI)] → [Django]
→ URL Routing → View → Model → (Optional) Template → Response
→ [Client]

📦 Optional Components
Celery + Redis: For background tasks (e.g., sending emails)
Django REST Framework (DRF): For building RESTful APIs
Docker: For containerizing the application
CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI for automated deployment
